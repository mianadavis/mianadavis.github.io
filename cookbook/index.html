            <b>INGREDIENTS</b> 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Kosher Salt</li>
            <li>12 ounces Pene Pasta</li>
            <li>8 ounces Ground Beef</li>
            <li>3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese (about 1 1/2 ounces)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>3/4 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic (1 minced, 2 sliced)</li>
            <li>2 1/2 pounds beefsteak tomatoes, halved</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vodka</li>
            <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>Freshly ground pepper</li>
        </ul>     
        <b>DIRECTIONS</b>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta 
                    and cook as the label directs. Reserve 1/2 cup cooking water, 
                    then drain.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile, mix the beef, 1/4 cup parmesan, the breadcrumbs, egg, 
                    1/2 cup basil, the minced garlic and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a 
                    large bowl with your hands until just combined. Form into 
                    3/4-inch meatballs (about 20). Grate the tomatoes into a medium 
                    bowl;discard the skins.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the olive 
                    oil, then the meatballs. Cook, turning, until browned on all 
                    sides, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the sliced garlic and cook until 
                    just golden, about 1 minute. Gradually add the vodka, then the 
                    grated tomatoes and cream. Bring to a simmer and cook until the 
                    sauce thickens and the meatballs are cooked through, 8 to 10 
                    minutes. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of 
                    pepper.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Add the pasta and the remaining 1/4 cup basil to the skillet; 
                    toss,adding the reserved cooking water as needed to loosen. 
                    Remove from the heat and add the remaining 1/2 cup parmesan; 
                    toss.

        <b>DIRECTIONS</b>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Heat the oil in a medium oven-safe nonstick skillet over 
                    medium-high heat. Add the bell peppers and onion and cook, 
                    stirring occasionally, until softened, 6 to 7 minutes. Add the 
                    spinach, sun-dried tomatoes and garlic and cook, stirring 
                    frequently, until the spinach is just wilted and still vibrant 
                    green, about 1 minute.

                <p>
                    Reduce the heat to low and add the eggs, 1 teaspoon salt and 
                    a few grinds of black pepper. Stir gently to distribute the 
                    vegetables. Bake until the eggs are set, 13 to 15 minutes.

        <ul>
            <li>Ice cubes</li>
            <li>3 ounces tequila</li>
            <li>2 ounces freshly squeezed lime juice</li>
            <li>1 ounce Simple Syrup, recipe follows</li>
            <li>1/2 to 1 teaspoon orange liqueur</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Lime-salt-sugar, recipe follows</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>Zest of one lime</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Fill a cocktail shaker with ice. Add tequila, lime juice, 
                    Simple Syrup and orange liqueur. Cover and shake until mixed 
                    and chilled, about 30 seconds. (In general, the drink is ready 
                    by the time the shaker mists up.) Place Lime-salt-sugar on a 
                    plate. Press the rim of a chilled rocks or wine glass into the 
                    mixture to rim the edge. Strain margarita into the glass.

                    Put the sugar and water in a small saucepan. Cook over low heat, 
                    stirring, until the sugar dissolves. (Alternatively, heat in 
                    the microwave.) Store in a sealed container in the refrigerator 
                    for up to 1 month.
