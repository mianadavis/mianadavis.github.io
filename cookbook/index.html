        <b>INGREDIENTS</b> 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>12 ounces Pene Pasta</li>
        <li>8 ounces Ground Beef</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese (about 1 1/2 ounces)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>3/4 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic (1 minced, 2 sliced)</li>
        <li>2 1/2 pounds beefsteak tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vodka</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>Freshly ground pepper</li>
    </ol>     
    <b>DIRECTIONS</b>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <h3><li></h3>
            Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta 
            and cook as the label directs. Reserve 1/2 cup cooking water, 
            then drain.
        </li>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3><li></h3>
            Meanwhile, mix the beef, 1/4 cup parmesan, the breadcrumbs, egg, 
            1/2 cup basil, the minced garlic and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large 
            bowl with your hands until just combined. Form into 3/4-inch 
            meatballs (about 20). Grate the tomatoes into a medium bowl; 
            discard the skins.
        </li>
    </p>
    <p>
       <h3><li></h3>
            Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the olive oil, 
            then the meatballs. Cook, turning, until browned on all sides, 
            2 to 3 minutes. Add the sliced garlic and cook until just golden, 
            about 1 minute. Gradually add the vodka, then the grated tomatoes 
            and cream. Bring to a simmer and cook until the sauce thickens and 
            the meatballs are cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Season with 1/2 
            teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper.
        </li>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3><li></h3>
            Add the pasta and the remaining 1/4 cup basil to the skillet; toss, 
            adding the reserved cooking water as needed to loosen. Remove from 
            the heat and add the remaining 1/2 cup parmesan; toss.
        </li>

    <b>DIRECTIONS</b>
    <p>

            Heat the oil in a medium oven-safe nonstick skillet over 
            medium-high heat. Add the bell peppers and onion and cook,

            spinach, sun-dried tomatoes and garlic and cook, stirring

            green, about 1 minute.

        <h3><li></h3>
            Reduce the heat to low and add the eggs, 1 teaspoon salt and a 
            few grinds of black pepper. Stir gently to distribute the 
            vegetables. Bake until the eggs are set, 13 to 15 minutes.

    </p>
    <p>
        <h3><li></h3>
